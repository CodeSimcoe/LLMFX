LLM FX
--
A LLM Desktop Client free for everyone! 

This was supposed to be my tests with the Ollama4J API but I could not stop bringing features to it, so it became my own Deskptop client for Ollama, later made it for any OpenAPI compatible server using langchain4j. I believe that others may be interested and even contribute!

More updates and roadmaps soon!
